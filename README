MultiDop README
---------------
MultiDop is a Python-based interface between the C-based DDA code developed at
University of Oklahoma and the Python Atmospheric Radiation Measurement
Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) software developed at Argonne National Lab. Use this
software to perform 3D wind analyses using 2-3 independent Doppler radars.

To install:
1. Edit the Makefile in the src/ directory to match the compiler and path
   information relevant to your system.
2. “python setup.py install” in the master directory.

The installation will compile the DDA binary, which is the analysis engine, as
well as install the overall Python package. To see how to run the software,
view the example Jupyter notebooks.

If you use this software to produce an analysis for a presentation or
publication, you *must* cite the following papers:

Potvin and Shapiro dual Doppler analysis (DDA).
cd to src, edit Makefile. Go:
make
make install
or
make install PREFIX=my_binary_dir

Requires C99 and FORTRAN 77 compilers, and NetCDF.

To run, edit a copy of src/params.dda. Then go "DDA myparams.dda"
